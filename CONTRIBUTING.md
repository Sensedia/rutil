# Contributing

## Requirements

* Install the following packages: ``git`` and a text editor of your choice. By default, the use of [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) is recommended.

* VSCode (https://code.visualstudio.com), combined with the following plugins, helps the editing/review process, mainly allowing the preview of the content before the commit, analyzing the Markdown syntax and generating the automatic summary, as the section titles are created/changed.

    * Markdown-lint: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint
    * Markdown-toc: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AlanWalk.markdown-toc
    * Markdown-all-in-one: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one

* Configure authentication on your Github account to use the SSH protocol instead of HTTP. Watch this tutorial to learn how to set up: https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account
